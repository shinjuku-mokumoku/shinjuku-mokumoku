Mainly apply deep learning algorithms into computer vision. I also have started doing some research on NLP and RL.

Deep Learning algorithms, math, English, fitness

## ¡“ú‚â‚é‚±‚Æ
Since I join in a study group where PRML book is used, I will implement some of the algorithms from the book.
After that, I may also try to implement some word2vec and RL algorithms.

Nothing.

## ¡“ú‚Ì¬‰Ê
I implemented some algorithms from PRML(Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning) book.
I could not finish implementing a regularization term, which is used to restrict weights to having high value.
